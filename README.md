Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Login to Vercel:
```bash
vercel login
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts. For the first deployment, it will ask you to link the project. After that, you can use `vercel --prod` to deploy to production.

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy automatically

That's it! Your site will be live at a URL like `your-project-name.vercel.app`
